I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/dsai/">Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)</a> at <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)</a>. Before joining PolyU, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at Yale University, and served as an Assistant Professor at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Hong Kong Institute of Science & Innovation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong in 2022, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/people/people.htm">Yixuan Yuan</a>. I received my M.Phil. degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2019, and my B.Eng. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2016 with admission to XJTU-CASIA Automation Elite Class.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
My research interests focus on the intersection of AI and Healthcare. My work aligns with the human healthcare pipeline, encompassing multimodal clinical diagnosis, surgical intervention, and medical foundation models with the goal of building next-generation healthcare systems. In recognition of the research on AI-assisted diagnosis and surgery, I was awarded the Hong Kong Young Scientist Award 2023, the sole winner in the engineering field that year.
