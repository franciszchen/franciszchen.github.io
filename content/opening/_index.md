<p>
We are actively seeking self-motivated <span2><b>Ph.D. Students, Research Assistants, and Visiting Students</b></span2> to join the <b>Healthcare AI Lab</b> at PolyU DSAI.
</p>
<p>
Our lab stands at the forefront of the <b>Generative AI revolution in healthcare</b>. We bridge the gap between fundamental AI innovation and clinical reality, aiming to develop <span2><b>Generalizable, Agentic, and Multimodal AI systems</b></span2> that can perceive, reason, and act in complex medical environments.
</p>
<p>
👉 <b>Our latest works and publications can be found in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oVG2zEkAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.</b>
</p>

<br>
<h2><b>🔬 Research Pillars</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Medical Foundation Models:</b> Developing multimodal LLMs integrating medical imaging, surgical video, EHR, and biomedical literature for holistic clinical reasoning.</li>
<li><b>Agentic AI for Healthcare:</b> Building clinical agents and embodied copilots capable of autonomous planning and video-language-action learning.</li>
<li><b>Translational AI:</b> Moving beyond algorithms to build deployable prototypes and conducting rigorous clinical validation in real-world settings.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>🚀 Why Join Us?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Frontline Research:</b> Work on cutting-edge topics (e.g., <b>LLM Agents, Vision-Language Models, World Models</b>) with a supervisor who has first-hand expertise in building foundation models.</li>
<li><b>Proven Mentorship:</b> Our philosophy is to help every student reach their full potential by providing training in independent research for future careers. Previous students under my mentorship have secured Ph.D. positions at top institutions such as <span2><b>Cambridge, Edinburgh, Nottingham, and UIUC</b></span2>.</li>
<li><b>Clinical Resources:</b> Benefit from long-term collaborations with clinicians in USA, Hong Kong and Mainland hospitals, with access to high-quality medical data and expert feedback.</li>
<li><b>Solid Support:</b> We provide ample GPU resources and international collaboration opportunities, and fully support fellowship and scholarship applications (e.g., HKPFS, PPPFS, PRPgS).</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>🎯 Requirements</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>BS/MS degree in CS, AI, DS, EE, BME, Math, Automation, or related fields.</li>
<li>Solid math foundation, proficient in Python/PyTorch, and familiar with modern network architectures.</li>
<li>Experience in CV, NLP, or Deep Learning. Prior work on LLMs or Agents is a strong plus.</li>
<li>A genuine passion for solving healthcare problems and resilience in tackling high-impact questions.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>📝 How to Apply</b></h2>
<p>
Please email <span2><b>zchen.francis@gmail.com</b></span2> with the subject: <span2><b>“Application for [Position] – [Your Name] – [Current University]”</b></span2>. The email requires the attachments to be merged into a single PDF:
