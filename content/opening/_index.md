<p>
We are actively seeking self-motivated <b>Ph.D. students, Research Assistants, and Visiting Students</b> to join the <b>AI for Healthcare Lab</b> at PolyU DSAI.
</p>
<p>
Our lab stands at the forefront of the <b>Generative AI</b> revolution in healthcare. We bridge the gap between fundamental AI innovation and clinical reality, aiming to develop <b>Generalizable, Agentic, and Multimodal AI systems</b> that can perceive, reason, and act in complex medical environments.
</p>

<br>
<h2><b>Research Pillars</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Medical Foundation Models:</b> Developing multimodal LLMs integrating medical imaging, surgical video, EHR, and biomedical literature for holistic clinical reasoning.</li>
<li><b>Agentic AI for Healthcare:</b> Building clinical agents and embodied copilots capable of autonomous planning and decision-making.</li>
<li><b>Translational AI:</b> Moving beyond algorithms to build deployable prototypes and conducting rigorous clinical validation in real-world settings.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>Why Join Us?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Frontline Research:</b> Work on cutting-edge topics (e.g., <b>LLM Agents, Vision-Language Models</b>) with a supervisor who has first-hand expertise in building foundation models.</li>
<li><b>Proven Mentorship:</b> Our philosophy is to help every student reach their full potential. Previous students under my mentorship have secured Ph.D. positions at top institutions such as <b>Cambridge, Edinburgh, Nottingham, and UIUC</b>.</li>
<li><b>Clinical Resources:</b> Benefit from long-term collaborations with clinicians in the <b>USA (Yale), Hong Kong, and Mainland China</b>, with access to high-quality medical data and expert feedback.</li>
<li><b>Solid Support:</b> We provide ample GPU resources and fully support fellowship applications (e.g., <b>HKPFS, PPPFS, PRPgS</b>).</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>Requirements</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Background:</b> BS/MS degree in CS, AI, DS, EE, Math, Automation, or related fields.</li>
<li><b>Technical Skills:</b> Solid math foundation, proficient in <b>Python/PyTorch</b>, and familiar with modern architectures (e.g., Transformers, Diffusion).</li>
<li><b>Research Experience:</b> Experience in CV, NLP, or Deep Learning. Prior work on <b>LLMs or Agents</b> is a strong plus.</li>
<li><b>Mindset:</b> A genuine passion for solving healthcare problems and resilience in tackling high-impact questions.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>How to Apply</b></h2>
<p>
Please email <b>zchen.francis@gmail.com</b> with the subject: <b>“Application for [Position] – [Your Name] – [Current University]”</b>.
</p>
<p><b>Required Attachments (Single PDF):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>CV:</b> Highlighting GPA, technical stack, and publications.</li>
<li><b>Transcripts:</b> Undergraduate and Master's records.</li>
<li><b>Research Statement:</b> A brief outline (1-2 pages) of your experience and interest in our directions.</li>
<li><b>Representative Work:</b> 1-3 papers or project links (GitHub).</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>Notes</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Response Policy:</b> Please be assured that I personally review every application with care. However, due to the high volume of inquiries, <b>I will only be able to contact shortlisted candidates for interviews.</b> I genuinely appreciate your time and interest in our lab, and wish you the very best in your academic journey.</li>
<li><b>For HKPFS Candidates:</b> Please contact me early (before <b>October</b>) if you have an outstanding academic record.</li>
</ul>
