<p>
We are actively seeking self-motivated <span2><b>Ph.D. students, Research Assistants, and Visiting Students</b></span2> to join the <span2><b>AI for Healthcare Lab</b></span2> at PolyU DSAI.
</p>
<p>
Our lab stands at the forefront of the <span2><b>Generative AI</b></span2> revolution in healthcare. We bridge the gap between fundamental AI innovation and clinical reality, aiming to develop <span2><b>Generalizable, Agentic, and Multimodal AI systems</b></span2> that can perceive, reason, and act in complex medical environments.
</p>
<p>
👉 <b>Our latest works and publications can be found in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oVG2zEkAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.</b>
</p>

<br>
<h2><b>🔬 Research Pillars</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><span2><b>Medical Foundation Models:</b></span2> Developing multimodal LLMs integrating medical imaging, surgical video, EHR, and biomedical literature for holistic clinical reasoning.</li>
<li><span2><b>Agentic AI for Healthcare:</b></span2> Building clinical agents and embodied copilots capable of autonomous planning and <span2><b>video-language-action learning</b></span2>.</li>
<li><span2><b>Translational AI:</b></span2> Moving beyond algorithms to build deployable prototypes and conducting rigorous clinical validation in real-world settings.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>🚀 Why Join Us?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><span2><b>Frontline Research:</b></span2> Work on cutting-edge topics (e.g., <span2><b>LLM Agents, Vision-Language Models</b></span2>) with a supervisor who has first-hand expertise in building foundation models.</li>
<li><span2><b>Proven Mentorship:</b></span2> Our philosophy is to help every student reach their full potential, providing training in independent research for future careers. Previous students under my mentorship have secured Ph.D. positions at top institutions such as <span2><b>Cambridge, Edinburgh, Nottingham, and UIUC</b></span2>.</li>
<li><span2><b>Clinical Resources:</b></span2> Benefit from long-term collaborations with clinicians in <span2><b>USA, Hong Kong and Mainland hospitals</b></span2>, with access to high-quality medical data and expert feedback.</li>
<li><span2><b>Solid Support:</b></span2> We provide ample GPU resources and fully support fellowship and scholarship applications (e.g., <span2><b>HKPFS, PPPFS, PRPgS</b></span2>).</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><b>🎯 Requirements</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><span2><b>Background:</b></span2> BS/MS degree in CS, AI, DS, EE, Math, Automation, or related fields.</li>
<li><span2><b>Technical Skills:</b></span2> Solid math foundation, proficient in <span2><b>Python/PyTorch</b></span2>, and familiar with modern architectures (e.g., Transformers, Diffusion).</li>
<li><span2><b>Research Experience:</b></span2> Experience in CV, NLP, or Deep Learning. Prior work on <span2><b>LLMs or Agents</b></span2> is a strong plus.</li>
